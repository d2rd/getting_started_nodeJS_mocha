<!--The following command is used to invoke the Mocha binary installed locally in the ./node_modules directory:

./node_modules/.bin/mocha --reporter spec

Note that we have also changed the standard reporter that Mocha uses, and set up the spec reporter that is more verbose, and thus more suitable for beginners. You can explore other reporters on Mocha's official website.
